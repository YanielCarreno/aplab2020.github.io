Currently, I am in the final year of my PhD in Robotics and Autonomous Systems at the <a href="https://www.edinburgh-robotics.org/" style="float: ;">Edinburgh Centre for Robotics</a>, a doctoral training centre jointly operated by the <a href="https://www.hw.ac.uk/" style="float: ;">Heriot-Watt University</a> and the <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics" style="float: ;">University of Edinburgh</a>.  My dissertation, “Long-Term Autonomy forMulti-Vehicle Systems in the Maritime Domain”, is supervised by <a href="https://researchportal.hw.ac.uk/en/persons/yvan-petillot" style="float: ;">Prof. Yvan Petillot</a> and <a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rpetrick/" style="float: ;">Dr. Ron Petrick</a>. My PhD is sponsored by <a href="https://www.baesystems.com/en/our-company/our-businesses/maritime" style="float: ;">BAE Systems Surface Ships Ltd.</a>  with an expected end date of Febraury 2022. For the last two years, I have also been working as Research Assistant on Automated Planning and Robotics, developing “High-Level Task Planning Strategies for Multi-Domain Platforms” in the EPSRC Offshore Robotics for Certification of Assets (<a href="https://orcahub.org/" style="float: ;">ORCA Hub</a>) project. I hold a MSc in Robotics and Autonomous Systems, from Heriot-Watt University and University of Edinburgh in 2018, with Distinction and a MEng in Electronic and Digital Systems from the <a href="https://www.strath.ac.uk/" style="float: ;">University of Strathclyde</a> in 2017, with Distinction. Prior to this I did four years of the programme of BEng in Automatic at Universidad Central Marta Abreu de Las Villas in Cuba.
